Developing a software where age old pension applications are queued up and pulled up
Problem Statement:
Department is currently enrolling all Old Age Pension Scheme beneficiariesx online through e-District Portal.
The Scheme has a finite number of vacancies of each constituency.
Once the available vacancies are filled-up,the portal does not accept any new forms, nor are they queued up.
Whereas as the cases are processed, some may be rejected and accordindly some vacancies will become available.
